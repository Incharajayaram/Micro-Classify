# Micro-Doppler-Based-Target-Classification
## Project Overview

The Micro-Doppler Based Target Classification project focuses on distinguishing between drones and non-drones (such as birds) by analyzing micro-Doppler signatures captured from radar sensors. This technology is essential for improving situational awareness in scenarios such as surveillance, search and rescue missions, and safeguarding critical infrastructure. The project encompasses:

Signal Processing: Obtained dataset from IEEE Dataport.
Machine Learning: Implementing Python-based models to classify objects based on the extracted features.
Web Application: Creating an intuitive interface for users to interact with the classification system.
